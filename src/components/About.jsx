                            Hi, I'm <span>Anil Kumar</span>, a passionate and dedicated web developer
                            who loves turning ideas into reality through code. I specialize in building
                            responsive and user-friendly websites using <b>HTML, CSS, JavaScript,</b> and <b>React.js</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I enjoy solving real-world problems and continuously improving my skills
                            through hands-on projects. My goal is to become a full-stack developer and
                            work on innovative projects that make a positive impact.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When I’m not coding, I enjoy learning about new technologies and improving
                            my problem-solving abilities.
                        </p>
